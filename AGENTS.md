> Commits you push to the connected branch sync back to Lovable and show up in

- APK download URL and release info live only in src/config/app.ts (APP_CONFIG) — one place to update per release.
- App showcase pictures use CDN asset pointers and the shared carousel controls so uploads stay outside the repository and browsing stays consistent.
